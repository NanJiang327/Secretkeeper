# Secret Keeper
This is a fantanstic app we developed in AUT's Software Development Practice course (SDP). The method we used to develope this app is agile. And scrum is the framework.

The app is used for people to store their secret. The interesting feature is that people can also exchange their secret and view other people's secret anonymously by searching the secret ID. Also there are some little game inside to let the customer play to unlock other people's secret.
