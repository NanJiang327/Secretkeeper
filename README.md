# Secret Keeper
This is a fantanstic app we developed in AUT's Software Development Practice course (SDP). The methodology we used to develope this app is agile. And scrum is the framework.

The app is used for people to store their secrets. One interesting feature is that people can also exchange their secrets and view other people's secret anonymously by searching the secret's ID. Also there are some little games inside so the customer can play and unlock other people's secrets.

### Game Page
This little game is called '2048'. 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. 2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.
